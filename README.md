# Data_Mining_and_Data_Warehousing

## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive approach to data mining and warehousing using the **Adult Census Income** dataset. The primary goal is to preprocess, analyze, and apply predictive modeling techniques on census data to classify individuals' income brackets based on various socio-economic factors.

### Project Objectives
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean, encode, and preprocess categorical and numerical data.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identify and remove outliers and extreme values using the IQR method.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Train and evaluate a Decision Tree (J48) classifier to predict income levels.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Measure model performance on datasets with and without outliers and extreme values.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebook with the full analysis and code walkthrough.
- `src/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, outlier detection, and modeling.
